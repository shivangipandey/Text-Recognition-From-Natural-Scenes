# Text-Recognition-From-Natural-Scenes
My network is detecting texts from natural scenes with 86% accuracy till date.
I've used computer vision algorithms like MSER, SWT etc. and sliding window Convolution neural network for detection and recognition of images. 
For optimisers, I've used two different optimisers (Adam and Moment) with different learning rates, one after another, which results in the increase of accuracy by 4%.
